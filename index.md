Some convenient [Docker](http://docker.com) images for the ARM Platform, built on the Raspberry Pi.

## Base images

The base images include only the operating system itself, nothing other. They are built automatically with Jenkins CI. The Jobs are defined in Jenkins DSL as found in the [armhero/jenkins-dsl](https://github.com/armhero/jenkins-dsl) repository.
